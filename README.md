# Project Name
This project is to make a chatbot by using javascript. 

## The problem
I've had a really hard time with this project! I didn't understand how to use functions and to declare variables. I've watched the videos over and over, but couldn't grasp it. I tried to solve the problem by watching youtube videos, asking chatgpt, and reading articles. I'm sure I'd figure it out if I had more time.
